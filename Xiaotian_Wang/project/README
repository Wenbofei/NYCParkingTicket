First, put the data file in the "data/" directory and then split it.

To split data, we use

---
split -d -l 50000 FILENAME1 "201?data"
---

Here, the "201?" is the year of the data.

To get the namelist, we use 

---
ls > namelist201?
---

and then delete the non-relevant lines artificially.

Now, run the "rename.sh" which is 

---
#!/bin/bash

head0=$(head -1 2017data00)

for i in $(cat namelist2017)
do
if [ "$i"x != "data00"x ]
then
sed -i "1i$head0" $i
fi
done


for i in $(cat namelist2017)
do
mv $i $i.csv
done
---

The "2017" here can be adjusted to be "201?" which is the year of the data.

To merge the results, we first move all *counts to a same directory by

---
mkdir results
mv *counts results/
---

,and then run

---
paste -d, counts* > result201?.csv
---

to get the merged result of the year.

Now, we can use other tools (sucb as R studio) to deal with the merged result.
